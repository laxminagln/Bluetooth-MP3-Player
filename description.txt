You will need your Arduino, bluetooth module, sensors, breadboard and wires here.
1. First, prepare the materials.
2. Know your pins. I'm using HC-05 bluetooth module in this prototype, any bluetooth 
   module is compatible. You may refer to this page.
3. After getting the right pins, power up the module by connecting 3.3V and ground 
   to module's Vcc pin and ground pin respectively. Your Android phone only receives 
   data, therefore we only need Tx pin of Arduino to Rx pin of module. Please follow 
   the right voltage divider or you may see the magic white smoke appear ones. I use 
   220 ohms and 1k ohms.
4. After setting up the module, lets start with the sensors. You also need to learn 
   the name of each pins for proper connection for LM35.
5. Connect the signal pin of LM35 to A0 of Arduino. For LDR(light-dependent resistor), 
   you don't need to worry about the pins, Drag 1k ohm resistor(brown black red) to 
   ground and LDR one pin to the 1k ohm resistor, same pin of LDR where 1k ohm resistor 
   connected,connect this node to A1 of Arduino and the other pin of LDR will be 5V. 
   The circuit is on the picture.
6. And now you're done. Plug the USB cable for programming the Arduino.

Additional Notes
1. You can not tap START button unless you are connected to a Bluetooth device.
2. The App will hang and cause run-time error if no data is received.
3. I haven't fix the bug where no songs on playlists and then you start playing the player. 
   The app generates a random operation from 1 to maximum number of songs stored.
4. Set your phone wake lock to maximum or else your music will stop playing. There is no 
   function in app inventor that you can play song even if the screen is off.
